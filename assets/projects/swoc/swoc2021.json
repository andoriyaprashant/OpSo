        "Description": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. When cancers are found early, they can often be cured. There are some devices that detect breast cancer but many times they lead to false positives, which results in patients undergoing painful, expensive surgeries that were not even necessary. These types of cancers are called benign which do not require surgeries and we can reduce these unnecessary surgeries by using Machine Learning. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing unnecessary surgeries for a woman. This project helps us to identify breast cancer in women that helps us to save many lives.",
