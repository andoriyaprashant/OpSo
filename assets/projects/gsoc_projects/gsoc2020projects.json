Re-parsing of descriptors’ content has a noticeable effect on runtime performance. \nC++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of the C++ Code. C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules will be default on OS X.

The generator is updated by employing a policy gradient and Monte Carlo (MC) search on the basis of the expected end reward received from the discriminator model. The reward is estimated by the likelihood that it would fool the discriminator model. We envisage that this approach will result in more fluent and adequate verbalizations. It is also noteworthy that this would be a novel approach to solve the problem statement which has never been previously explored in literature. Closest available research is that of (Yu et al., 2017), however they do not rely on graphical input representations for their model, and employ an RNN based encoding module within their generator network.</p>\n",

The whole process of learning will be carried out by using the data it will get fed in such surroundings during real life scenarios. This project will be an expansion of the previous work “Learning socially acceptable behavior using machine learning techniques on graph data” (<a href=\"https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/robocomp/sngnn</a>) in that project algorithms were developed to produce a single score for the robot to navigate, but it required high number of queries to work. This time we are aiming for generating these scores as a heatmap(such as the heat maps shown in <a href=\"https://ljmanso.com/sngnn\" target=\"_blank\">https://ljmanso.com/sngnn</a>) which can produce all the scores at once, this will be more efficient and faster than the previous work done. To solve this issue of generating all the scores at once we will try to generate a bitmap image using CNNs. As we are dealing with graphs of scenarios here we will be using GNNs.</p>\n",

Schema service is designed as a REST full web service and mainly it manages GA4GH JSON Sachems. Schema Repository is the persistence layer for Schema Service and JSON schemas can be stored within the schema repository for retrieval.

In addition, bi-directional bus communication using GPIOs is infeasible, as each GPIO is configured for either input or output. This project will combine your hardware and software skills to address these limitations by creating a shift register-based hardware design that will allow serial streams of data going in/out of the PocketBeagle or BeagleBone family GPIOs to be mapped into a bi-directional communications bus</p>\n",

Usually, electron density assigned in the atoms that constitute the molecule is a key element in this process. This partitioning of the electrons itself do not suggest any observable properties of a molecule. However, many observable features of a molecule are derived directly from the electron densities, hence motivating chemists to relentlessly improve this <em>noumena</em> step by step.\nCurrently, cclib can calculate some common atomic charge potential methods, including C-squared Population Analysis, Mulliken Population Analysis, and Lowdin Population Analysis. Because Mulliken Population Analysis and Lowdin Population Analysis are similar in its theory (Lowdin uses a different basis set to reduce the basis set dependence observed in Mulliken Analysis), it would be advantageous to have other modern calculation methods implemented in cclib. Some examples of the methods that can be implemented include DDEC6, Hirshfeld method, Bader analysis, ISA (through a bridge to Horton) and so on.</p>\n",

While developing Elytron the idea was to provide a better and stronger authentication and build something that does more than just unifying the security solution. Intrusion Detection using Elytron is aimed at doing the same i.e. to extend Elytron’s functionality. \nIntrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely to occur.  The purpose of this project is to implement an Intrusion Detection system that detects suspicious activity or a potential attack and report it to the administrator.</p>\n",

The .diff files are created upon branching through git and can be saved, stored and rendered into documents with the help of automated tools developed by the Flax team. Moreover, additional branches of the master file are generated upon storing a diff in order to ensure the compatibility of future changes of the base examples with the HOWTOs. This not only allows the original examples to remain educational and general, but introduces a new system of visualizing application-specific complete workflows from both Google Brain and the community.</p>\n",

With a plethora of different sets of governing equations, neuronal models with complex biophysical properties, synapses with plasticity and parameters, a mechanism to derive generalized platform-independent model description becomes inevitable. Further, the model description mechanism helps in easy access and reproduction of the models, and thereby exasperating reference to the platform-specific source code shall be avoided. Currently, Brian uses <code>brian2tools.nmlexport</code> package to elegantly export Brian models to <code>NeuroML</code>. However, it is confined and cannot be extended easily to various other generalized model descriptors. Therefore, the project proposes an idea to create a generalized basic framework, which can coherently describe Brian models in a standard format and shall be easily extended to various other formats.

It also provides faster debugging of pre-existing bugs even by new developers, as they can easily jump to class/method definitions without having prior knowledge of the directory structure of the project. Sorbet serves as a tool to reduce brittle code, increases a developer’s confidence in their work and is a great tool for refactoring.

The latter one does the reverse, reads object files and emits YAML files. We use these tools to write unit tests for binary tools, e.g., llvm-objdump, llvm-nm, llvm-readelf, as YAML is easier to read and edit than raw assembly codes and pre-built binaries. More importantly, YAML keeps our tests code base maintainable. However, yaml2obj currently doesn’t support generating DWARF sections very well (we have to hardcode the Content field of DWARF sections and it is not intuitive). This project aims to add DWARF support for yaml2obj (ELF part), which will ease our pain crafting DWARF tests.</p>\n",

This operating mode in QEMU is called the user mode and it is much simpler than the more commonly known system mode in which the full computer system is emulated. The user mode is useful for fast cross execution and debugging and is usually executed on Linux based systems. It achieves this cross execution by having its' own implementations of system functions from the Linux kernel interface. Although many system functions are supported in QEMU, the kernel is constantly extended by addition of new system calls. QEMU user mode can't consistently follow this kernel extension and thus many kernel functions are left unimplemented. The goal of this project is to significantly extend this QEMUs implementation of system functions so that many user programs that depend on these system calls can be safely cross executed. This projects' contribution also extends to the Linux Test Project by developing unit tests for system functions implemented within QEMU.</p>\n",

The core OTIO API is written in C++. A lot of other higher level languages are popular for tooling. Many such languages (such as Lua, Go, Ruby, etc) are not directly compatible with C++ but have ways to interact with a C-API. So it would help if we have a C wrapper for OTIO. Java is one of the most versatile languages, also powering one of the most pervasive platforms - Android. Mobile Computing is becoming more powerful and widespread by the day.

However, the fMRI data modeling performed by TVB suffers from the drawback of considering a standard model for the underlying Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), throughout a brain and across various brain models. Several studies have indicated that HRF shows variability across both the subjects and across various brain regions of a particular subject. To account for the same, we aim at extending the rsHRF-toolbox  to interface between estimating region-specific resting-state HRF (rsHRF) from fMRI data, and modeling BOLD activity in TVB. The extended toolbox shall take fMRI data as input, estimate the region-specific rsHRF for regions (network nodes) defined by the connectome used in TVB, and mediate the fMRI data simulations through TVB's Bold monitor and BoldRegionROI monitor while accounting for the underlying HRF variability across the network. We also aim to build a GUI interface for the toolbox and consequently a docker implementation for the same as we expect end-users from various communities and backgrounds.</p>\n",

The following goal is achieved step by step, starting from a simple sequential implementation of 1D nonlocal diffusion. The 1D nonlocal diffusion equation is made multi-threaded to enable concurrent processing within a single node and then is extended to a 2D nonlocal diffusion equation.

Accurate numerical computation of these geodesics near Black Holes is paramount to advance our knowledge of the relativistic physics, surrounding these extreme gravitational objects, as the nearest stellar mass black hole is ~3000 ly away, making astronomical observations nearly impractical. Without proper astronomical reference to compare against, it is impossible to obtain data on the line profile of these celestial bodies, due to the appreciable general relativistic corrections required. In this project, we will consider two spacetime geometries, the Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics, and implement python modules, that (1) help in solving geodesic equations, given initial conditions; (2) raytracing photons (null geodesics); and (3) help in performing some advanced simulations and visualizations, like simulating accretion flow, gravitational lensing and calculations, related to redshifted photons due to the spacetime curvature, near these bodies. We will survey the existing state-of-the-art literature and pick a performant implementation for the two geometries.</p>\n",

The Pre-GSoC implementation of Symbolic PathFinder allows only to run symbolic execution with fixed neural network architecture, i.e., MNIST0. We have added another implementation which is more generic and supports symbolic execution for all types of neural network architectures. We evaluated our implementation using a variety of architectures, namely MNIST0, MNIST1, MNIST2, and CIFAR. Evaluation results verified the correctness of the implementation. We believe that this GSoC implementation will make it easier for researchers to analyze a wide variety of neural networks. This will enable them to improve the neural network performance as well as help in identifying the vulnerabilities in already existing neural network architectures.</p>\n",

Such a drawing of a planar graph is called a plane drawing. Every planar graph also admits a straight-line drawing, which is a plane drawing where each edge is represented by a line segment. When a graph has K5 or K3,3 as subgraph then the graph is not planar.  This algorithm is only applicable for <strong>undirected</strong> graphs. It has a linear time complexity of <strong>O(|V|)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Boost::make_connected</strong> Adds the minimum number of edges needed to make the input graph connected. The algorithm first identifies all of the connected components in the graph, then adds edges to connect those components together in a path. For example, if a graph contains three connected components A, B, and C, make_connected will add two edges. The two edges added might consist of one connecting a vertex in A with a vertex in B and one connecting a vertex in B with a vertex in C.  This algorithm is only applicable for <strong>undirected</strong> graphs.

Optimization of the app by reducing third party modules, checking memory leakage and improving testing feature for the app is one of my main goal. I would focus on improving the performance of the application by making code changes and using react hooks in our project. Additionally, I would implement new features like Password strength checker, Crashlytics and Email verification.</p>\n",

For a collaborative robot, dealing with objects is a key part of its job and its ability to manipulate objects starts with the accuracy of grasping. Intelligent control of a robotic arm to manipulate objects is based on detecting the object and understanding its pose. Precise 3D poses of the objects are necessary to achieve a successful grasp on the objects. We can use the available data from the surrounding environment to recognize the objects poses. In our environment, the data provided will be RGBD frames. Recent work in Deep Learning has achieved amazing results in the problem of 3d pose estimation using RGBD data.</p>\n<p>In this project, we will work to integrate a pose estimation component to RoboComp using some state-of-art work in Deep Learning. The output poses will be visualized in V-REP simulator and used to drive the new Kinova Gen3 arm, in order to precisely grasp and manipulate some objects.</p>\n",

Current infrastructure still faces limitations to tackle the expected increase in data in terms of storage capacity and computation time. Early event reconstructions were based on matrix element methods followed by Monte Carlo techniques. Recent advances focused on boosting the speed of event simulations. For instance, C++ - based DELPHES uses simplified detector geometries and particle-material interactions, hence mapping the detector response into a parametric function. Nevertheless, this technique is limited by its exclusiveness to a specific detector geometry at a time, with any detector changes requiring the framework to be adjusted accordingly through hand-coding. Falcon (previously Turbosim), a fast stimulation framework that uses non-parametric methods to discern detector responses without the need for hand-coding. That being said, we aim to investigate the efficiency of deep generative models in simulating event reconstructions in a given detector, hence potentially replacing conventional complex algorithms.</p>\n",

I will be collaborating with others to prepare activities for release and also test debian packages if needed. It is important to identify if the tracebacks are due to activity code, changes in versions of packages or due to difference in the test environment.</p>\n<p>So this project aims at making necessary changes to sugar activities to have at least 25 release ready activities.</p>\n",

The problem here is that most people do not want to sign in to Gitlab to send an issue and want something faster within the same interface of EOS. The aim of this project is to design a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new icons in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with the request to explain what they want. The admins or EOS maintainers can then resolve, close and revise these requests. Even users can comment and vote for the existing requests. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress. Thus, it potentially becomes another reusable open source project for EOS.</p>\n",

These techniques, unlike other 3D representations such\nas 3D volumes, have a low memory footprint and a good understanding of continuous 3D spatial data.\nRecently, these techniques have been applied to solve Computer Graphics specific problems (such as 3D\nscan denoising, 3D shape generation or illumination effect approximation) since, unlike images, they are\nable to work with continuous 3D data directly. Tensorflow Graphics provides a bast amount of tools\nto apply learning techniques to Computer Graphics problems and data. However, until now, it does\nnot include any point-based learning techniques among its layers, making its users rely on volume-based\nrepresentations only to represent 3D data. In this project, I plan to fill this gap by incorporating a set\nof point-based convolution techniques within Tensorflow Graphics.</p>\n",

        "abstract_html": "<p>Probabilistic models, which more naturally quantify uncertainty when compared to their deterministic counterparts, are often difficult and tedious to implement. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have greatly increased productivity of probabilistic modelers, allowing practitioners to focus on modeling, as opposed to the implementing algorithms for probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian) inference. Turing is a PPL developed entirely in Julia and is both expressive and fast due partly to Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler being implemented in LLVM.  Consequently, Turing has a more manageable code base and has the potential to be more extensible when compared to more established PPLs like STAN. One thing that may lead to the adoption of Turing is more benchmarks and feature comparisons of Turing to other mainstream PPLs. The aim of this project is to provide a more systematic approach to comparing execution times and features among several PPLs, including STAN, Pyro, nimble, and Tensorflow probability for a variety of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, which are a class of models that provide a much modeling flexibility and often allow model complexity to increase with data size.</p>\n",

In more recent times, the focus has shifted on pangenomes, that encode genomic variation across multiple individuals of a certain species.\nPangenome graphs (also called Variation Graphs) are used to store and represent pangenomes. Multiple open-source tools have been developed for building and analyzing Variation Graphs and VG (<a href=\"https://github.com/vgteam/vg\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/vgteam/vg</a>) is the most popular one. VG provides a framework to work with Variation Graphs, and it is currently capable of handling moderately-sized graphs. However, it has issues scaling up for large datasets.\nI want to improve its performances by building a highly parallel graph explorer that makes use of GPU architecture in Rust. GPUs are well known for their ability to do millions of operations at the same time, however achieving this requires code to be written in a speciﬁc, parallel-oriented way. I think that, with help from the mentors, this can surely happen, and VG will be able to explore Variation Graphs much faster.</p>\n",

First, before the GSoC 2020 starts, I intend to complete a Python API for retrieving the annotation dataset. Throughout the GSoC 2020, I will modify existing parsers and create neural networks to project semantic frames and frame elements to unannotated sentences. I mainly work with projections on the manually aligned sentences and aligned sentences generated through transitivity. In addition to suggesting techniques for tackling m:n alignment, I also propose metrics for evaluating the projections in binary and graded manners as well as a phraseological method for analyzing projections for metaphorical phrases. If time permits, I would create sentence alignment models for aligning EN-JP, EN-FR, EN-UR, and EN-HI sentences.</p>\n",

The extension will be just a visible component as opposed to non-visible component. This allows the extension to be placed under a <code>ComponentContainer</code> under which the extension can create its views.

The goal of this project is to create a persistent cache system for OpenSCAD which uses a key-value datastore to store cache. This implementation will handle a cache similar to the existing one.</p>\n",

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc within the system. It does this by maintaining a local XML-based database. This leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins master. Hence, the core idea of this project is to extend Jenkins core to support storing of fingerprints in an external storage, which would be managed by storage system specific plugins. This would involve designing and creating the external fingerprint storage API. The API would also allow multiple Jenkins instances to store their fingerprints inside a single external storage instance, enabling traceability of artifacts across the CI/CD flow. The project also involves creating two plugins, as reference implementations. These plugins would allow users to store fingerprints inside their Redis and PostgreSQL instances.</p>\n",

One of the most important parts of an end to end small satellite business is ground-based tracking. Satellite tracking provides valuable information on the whereabouts with the use of large antennas and high power transmitters at the price of expense and lead time.</p>\n<p>It is thus important to use an alternative tracking method, for example, Doppler Tracking. Doppler based orbit determination uses a doppler frequency shift to convert to a distance problem. Then, orbits may be directly fitted to the Doppler data in a trial and error fashion, but a much less laborious way of computing is to differentially correct an initial approximation of the orbit. This way the cost of the tracking system is kept low because equipment needs beyond the essential receiver are small, at a minimum consisting of an amplifier and a variable oscillator.</p>\n<p>So through this project, the goal is to determine the orbit of active satellites using Doppler shift by implementing an algorithm and simulate the final results.</p>\n",

In this project, we will implement a method from Schüssler et al.  \"Microfacet-based normal mapping for robust Monte Carlo path tracing\" which tackles with microfacet based normal mapping. The result of this method enables us to use arbitrary normal maps and BRDFs for defining the microfacet BRDF for the whole surface.

On the one hand, the usefulness of the hyperSpec package for spectroscopic research is clear\nand immediately useful to R programmers and practitioners of bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, and medical\nstatistics. On the other hand, the infrastructure afforded by hyperSpec has led to various dependencies on other\nR packages, large amounts of test data, and more than a hundred .R files. Accordingly, the current state of the\npackage has become difficult to maintain and vulnerable to fixes related to dependencies on deprecated\npackages. Thus, the project Fortification of the hyperSpec R Package aims to tackle these issues through distilling, shielding, and bridging the hyperSpec ecosystem.</p>\n",

Optimizing the clinical trial design is essential to decrease the cost of drug development. This becomes more complicated in the setup of personalized medicine and multi-stage adaptive enrichment design (mAED), where there are multiple subpopulations and multiple stages for decision making. The current approaches formulate mAED problem as a general linear programming (LP) problem, which is computationally expensive to solve. In this project, we aim to develop new customized algorithms and R package for this problem with three key features: 1) It provides a highly efficient solver to tackle a large and important class of LP problems; 2) It provides a solution for multi-stage decision-making problems with Bayes risk constraints; 3) It provides additional functions such as visualizing the optimal decision maps.</p>\n",

The project would touch upon other parts of the Matrix ecosystem for Go. Specifically the gomatrix library would need to be enhanced to support encryption-specific events (such as for the uploading and claiming of keys, handling of encrypted room events) and would potentially contain the bulk of the interactions with libolm, making it easier for future projects in Go to use the same functionality. Finally proper bindings for libolm need to be developed - some such projects exist but lack necessary operations for full E2E communications. The final result of this project would be go-neb working fully in encrypted rooms, as transparently as possible to its services.</p>\n",

Each version of python may need a pre-built wheel if there is native code. And to add support for python 3.7, 3.8 we have to add wheels in the third party  repo of 4 variants(oses) for each dependency.<br>\nb)We support Windows, Linux, macOS and possibly FreeBSD each with some possible architecture variants.

Computing the number of linear extensions, in general, takes O(n!) time, given a poset of n elements. However, many efficient algorithms are known for certain large classes of posets. SageMath offers a single function to calculate the linear extensions of a poset. For even small posets, this quickly becomes impossible to use. The goal of this project would be to implement efficient methods of computing linear extensions of several important classes of posets, and introduce uniform sampling of linear extensions. This includes tree posets, d-complete posets, skew diagrams, mobile posets, and more.</p>\n",

Specifically, in this proposed project, we will build a new tool for fine-tuning various object detectors provided in TF Hub, and another new tool for fine-tuning item embedding systems for structured data.

In addition to that, it is important to collect the hardware and software information of the nodes in each Grid site to fully identify the facilities provided by each Grid site. At the moment, a job can be submitted manually to the Grid to retrieve system information of a node, but it is a very tedious and time-consuming task to keep submitting jobs manually until the jobs cover all the Grid sites in WLCG. Also, it is very complex to analyze the result of each job manually.

However, newer long-read technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) are becoming more prevalent due to the advantages they offer over short reads. The main advantage of long reads is that they span a much larger portion of the genome or transcriptome, making it easier to detect events such as structural variants or isoforms. As more researchers begin to take advantage of long reads, GenPipes needs to evolve and support long-read technology in its main pipelines.\n    The objective of this project is to create a new RNA-seq pipeline (rnaseq_longreads), that supports long-read inputs. The new pipeline will be created based on the current versions of the RNA-seq pipeline, with the addition of the minimap2 aligner as well as StringTie v2 and Ballgown for generating transcript counts.\n    In addition to implementing a long-read RNA-seq pipeline within the GenPipes framework, short-read RNA-seq pipeline will also be updated to utilize StringTie2 and both pipelines will be tested to ensure that they are working properly.</p>\n",

FreeType is packed with a lot of complex font-related features, therefore, logging is an important aspect for this library.

Therefore, this facility fails on platforms lacking standard error. Since FreeType is used on a variety of platforms, there is a strong need to enhance the current logging facility beyond a standard error in order to ease the development and debugging.\nThe idea under this project is to enhance the existing design of writing logs to standard error to writing logs to the file system considering almost all platforms support input/output to files. \nThere are multiple logging libraries that are freely available in the market and are stable, which will do the job of printing logs to a file.\nHence, this project involves exploring the existing logging libraries, selecting one of them, integrating the same in FreeType and finally touching upon the testing part.</p>\n",

In the case of Musescore, the code was written manually for QT, with all the drawing and file handling code written manually. So the classes in libmscore follow this tree-like model somewhat informally, but not explicitly. I will be refactoring the code, such that the classes in libmscore follow this model exactly by adding a \"children\" list to the ScoreElement class. Many operations can then be written as tree traversals. This would prevent a lot of duplication in code, and simplify the code in a lot of places.</p>\n",

In the previous edition of GSOC the large scale network model for the macaque cortex, proposed by Mejias et. al, was successfully converted. A natural extension of this model was proposed in a paper by Joglekar et. al . Instead of using non-linear firing rate models, the cortical area was simulated as a spiking neuronal network. This was extremely useful to investigate the propagation of activity in the synchronous and asynchronous regime of the network. My goal in this project is to convert this model to PyNN allowing the simulation in several simulators.  As a secondary goal in this project, I would like to convert the model proposed by Demirtas et. al.   that is a large-scale circuit model of human cortex incorporating regional heterogeneity in microcircuit properties inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for parametrization across the cortical hierarchy and fitting models to resting-state functional connectivity.</p>\n",

However, compared with the state-of-the-art scene text recognition algorithms, the text and digit recognition samples in OpenCV are out of date. These samples are based on traditional classifiers, which is difficult to handle the complex scenarios in the real world. Hence, I propose to improve the text recognition samples with the representative algorithms of scene text recognition from our research group. Specifically, CRNN is a good choice for its high accuracy and efficiency. Because there are some unsupported network layers and operations in OpenCV, I will modify the related parts of the original network. Moreover, it is necessary to accelerate the text recognizor with the CUDA support in OpenCV DNN Module. In conclusion, I propose to implement a fast text recognition sample in OpenCV, and build a complete text spotting pipeline for scene text detection and recognition.</p>\n",

In support of this, BridgeInTech brings companies involvement by allowing them to offer a Mentoring Program which mentor and mentee can work on. It is hope that this active collaboration between companies, mentor and mentee can help narrow the tech skills gap.\nBridgeInTech also has another goal which is to promote equal opportunity by especially targeting those who are considered to be the minority in the industry. The categories such as gender, age, race, sexual orientation, physical/mental ability, socio economic, education, years of experience and religion, are used when getting information on user’s background. The company have an option to specify in their mentoring program the target candidates from the minority groups of the mentioned categories.

Although various developed countries have already planned how to do it and obtained good results, many developing countries are starting with this titanic challenge. Planning biodiversity inventories involves a series of complications that derive not only from economic capacities but also from the difficulty of designing a survey system that warranties registering most species in a region. Planning adequate survey systems is challenging as not only geographical factors influence species distributions. Species distributions depend on complicated relationships between accessible areas, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As a survey aims to register species in a region, biotic interaction could be overlooked. However, the relationship between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for biodiversity sampling.

In some areas this is a vast oversimplification of the physical reality; light exists on a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. Spectral rendering achieves better accuracy by taking that into account. The major drawback is that it cannot use widely available color data for surfaces such as photographs. The process of gathering usable spectral data is significantly more time- and resource-intensive.</p>\n<p>Spectral upsampling is the process of extrapolating spectral information from RGB color data. This is possible because, in practice, spectral reflectivities, which describe how a surface interacts with incident light on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis, tend to fit relatively simple patterns. The goal would be to add support for several newly published algorithms to Colour, a color science library for Python. With the rising popularity of spectral rendering, the library would greatly benefit from the work.</p>\n",

Volumetric soft body simulation can be used to capture the complex details of muscle and skin, e.g. volume preservation under collision/compression. In visual effects, such methods must also be robust to extreme deformation (no numerical blow-ups) and fast enough for interactive manipulation. Moreover, many of the underlying material models are nonlinear and computationally expensive, such as hyper-elastic models for realistic tissue or artistically-defined deformation. Toward these challenges I propose the implementation of a volumetric soft body solver in Blender, that is not only rapid and robust, but is general to hyper-elastic materials. The solver will also be capable of robustly resolving self-collisions and possibly other constraints. This would greatly improve the use of physics in Blender for animation pipelines.</p>\n",

A patch stack is a set of changes that modifies a body of code. Open source development is driven by applying patch stacks to an existing codebase. PaStA helps to analyse them and groups patches based on their similarity. A number of open source projects ( eg. the Linux kernel ) leverage mailing lists to support their development. All communication happens on these lists and contributors send patches to the lists for the maintainers to review. Given a mailbox of such a project PaStA can also map upstream commit references to corresponding patches in the mailbox. One of the major goals for PaStA has been to integrate with Patchwork. Patchwork is a web based patch tracking system. It helps both contributors track the state of their patches and maintainers efficiently review patches. As a first step PaStA can be used to automate the process of adding related patches to a patch on Patchwork. The primary goal of this project is to complete PaStA’s integration with Patchwork.</p>\n",

In the context of fonts, each pixel in a distance field image (or bitmap) is a shortest value from that pixel's position to the nearest edge of the outline of the corresponding glyph.\nDistance field is also known as distance transform and have various applications such as image processing, path-finding etc, but the main motive behind this project is to support high quality text rendering in real-time graphics applications (such as games). So, while rendering distance fields in such applications, the renderer can simply check the pixel's value and discard ones that are greater than a specific range. This makes distance fields almost infinity scalable without losing quality, this means you can use a 128x128 resolution distance transform and it will provide better quality than a 4k resolution image and will also require much less space. Moreover they can also be used to add many types of cool effects, like halos, drop shadows, bluring etc.\nSo, the goal of this project is to add support for generating signed distance fields from font files in FreeType.</p>\n",

The new features will also make it possible to render other planets skies, from a physically plausible mars sky to an alien sky with multiple suns and a stunning sky's color.</p>\n",

Since Google Summer of Code 2019, with the excellent work of Thanh Trung Dinh[1], the SSD-MobileNet and YOLO algorithms for face detection, and OpenFace for facial recognition have been implemented using OpenCV DNN. His work has achieved a great precision in face detection and facial recognition. However, there still are some issues that affect the performance of the facial engine. Therefore, the objective of this project is to improve the performance of the digiKam faces engine.</p>\n",

Although AFL++ allows users to define a dictionary, including language keywords, to help generate inputs, it still lacks more structured descriptions of the underlying syntax.</p>\n<p>To tackle the existing limitations of AFL++, the main goal of this project is to develop a pluggable grammar mutator that is integrated with AFL++’s mutation engine and can efficiently generate grammar-aware inputs. On one hand, like Nautilus, we want to combine grammar mutators with AFL++’s mutation engine. Also, we want to avoid the potential limitation of Nautilus: “over time Nautilus de-generates to structure-unaware greybox fuzzing”, as indicated by AFLSmart paper. On the other hand, we want to generate test cases efficiently as F1 fuzzer. Furthermore, to improve usability, we will develop a program generator that takes the grammar model as input and generates a mutator library, which is based on AFL++’s custom mutator APIs.</p>\n",

Another scenario is that the user has a slow network connection at the flight campaign location which is a common problem.

In the current RTEMS version, a lower-priority ready task must wait if all the processors included in its affinity mask are executing higher-priority tasks.

Strong APA scheduler would allow higher-priority tasks to be ”dislodged” or moved among processors in order to make space for lower priority tasks that are limited by affinity constraints [1].

However, the use of the IP fragmentation has significant drawbacks, for instance some network devices do not allow IP fragments to pass through and hence IKE communication is blocked.</p>\n<p>Intermediate Exchange is a solution to transfer large amounts of data in IKEv2. A series of these exchanges may take place after the IKE_SA_INIT phase and enable message fragmentation via IKE Fragmentation mechanism.

This can be a easy task for a experienced developer, but it keeps many creative developers away. So, I propose to implement a REPL based control of the PRU, hiding all the low level things behind the REPL and providing a clean interface to uses PRU. This can be achieved by implementing a PRU firmware which only runs some specific user defined commands delivered by RPMSG, executes and then sends a appropriate response. This can be achieved by offloading major task like lexing, parsing to the linux core, and through RPMSG only certain set of commands will be run, the high level code will be converted to these set of commands, on the linux machine itself.</p>\n",

The U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center processes more that 400.000 measurements daily taken by the Space Surveillance Network that includes a wide range of RF and electro-optical sensors. The catalog information can be augmented by the observations taken not only by high-end designated tracking assets, but also by cost-effective consumer-level sensors. \nWhile lacking high sensitivity, these sensors can still be used to perform uncued Initial Orbit Determination. Recently, in addition to electro-optical sensors, the appearance of low-cost Software-Defined Radios made it possible to deploy low-cost passive radar tracking stations. By using a network of such stations it might render possible to create and maintain an open-source orbiting object catalog. The proposed research is focused on developing software infrastructure to process measurements from multiple ground stations and perform orbit determination from Doppler observations.</p>\n",

These types of systems are idealized theoretical models that are used as good approximations of certain real combustion systems, or as building blocks towards more complex ones. The development of this solver will begin with mathematical modeling of the physical laws that define 0-D steady state combustion systems. It will require the application of numerical analysis techniques to quickly approximate accurate solutions. Then, it will be coded into the Cantera source code and thoroughly tested before release as a new feature in the next official version of Cantera.</p>\n",

Currently, operations have to be searched through highly nested and huge drop-downs. Also, you have to remember where the option was. Keyboard shortcuts don't solve the problem due to their learning curve, system shortcuts, and the limit on the number of keys that can humanly be pressed.\nCommand Palette(CP) is an interactive search bar that can search any operation (extensions, edits, filters, etc.) that Inkscape provides. CP is also a tool for the <strong>power users</strong> It speeds up the access times by using commands that help users to bypass the slow GUI and use mostly their speedy keyboards.\nAnother problem is repetition. The ordered nature of most drawings calls for repetition. As we know Inkscape is a tool for creative people and nothing kills creativity faster than repetition. \nMacros are a way to record your actions and repeat them. Command Stack provides a GUI way to make macros.</p>\n",

But the API as implemented by the FHIR module provides a very minimal search functionality for most of the resources where you can search by either only one or a few search parameters. There is no search functionality using advanced parameters like _include, _sort, _summary etc. Moreover, there are Lucene indices available for some FHIR resources and the search API for FHIR module doesn’t exploit these indices to provide a quicker search.</p>\n<p>This project is aimed at improving the search API and implementing/providing support for more complex search operations. It takes into account implementing the search parameters which have already not been implemented for each of the core resources. It would make use of the Lucene index for resources where it is available. Currently, all the search results are returned by the server corresponding to the set of search parameters specified by the user. But this is not always desirable and it is more efficient to return only the top most useful results at a go and hence, this forms an important part of this project by implementing paging for the resources.</p>\n",

This can be one of the reasons why CircuitVerse’s maximum traffic is from developed countries with above-average or good internet connectivity like the USA(26%), India(11%), UK(6%) and Canada(4%). It would be a big step towards increasing accessibility to have an offline App. Hence, I propose the third part of my proposal: An offline electron app for CircuitVerse.</p>\n",

Initially, I had envisioned the project with Flutter completely for cross-platform support as it suited the project idea. But along my way, working out the details and developing the sample prototype for the project idea, I got to know that ‘Landmark Detection’ from the Firebase Vision API in particular wasn’t yet supported with Flutter. To make it work, I needed to write quite good amount of native code for both Android and iOS platforms. If we were use to use on-device processing, that would make the app itself heavy since we would need to train our own custom ML model with a lot of data as an user can try to detect a monument from any angle possible. All these points, got me to reject the idea of Flutter for the complete app development. But at the same time, Flutter really has some great benefits such as extremely good UX/UI development, smooth performance, faster productive development, multiplatform support for future using same codebase. So I thought why not develop a native Android application and integrate Flutter with it for the frontend work and some backend work binding as well if needed.</p>\n",

This will be made possible by incorporating an element of body temperature in the game. The body temperature comes into play in the climatically extreme biomes namely- Desert and Snow.\nThe players will suffer some consequences should they choose to traverse these biomes without any preparation. To explore these biomes the player will have to look for ways to overcome these obstacles. However, these ways will not be present so readily. The players will have to look for these ways in other biomes. This will be made possible by some other enhancements in the form of additional items such as Wool Armor, Arabic Thawb, Water skins, Sand Slippers and an additional feature- hunting with traps. \nPlayers who are up to the challenge to explore the extreme biomes despite the obstacles  would have something to look forward to. Certain surprise structures namely Oasis for the Desert and Igloos for the Snow will be incorporated which would also be beneficial to the players in avoiding the extreme conditions.</p>\n",

By utilizing the capabilities of SBML via its spatial package, XitoSBML can create spatial SBML models from microscopic cellular images. However, this package has only been partially implemented and is still under development. A poignant requirement of this development process is a large number of test models, which can be provided as deliverables via this project to the SBML repository.

It is concerned with the computation of topological invariants of curves on surfaces. The goal of this project is to add a new functionality to this package in order to decide if an input cycle on a given surface can be continuously deformed to a simple curve, i.e. a curve without self-intersection. The goal is to implement the algorithm described in this paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327</a> (Computing the Geometric Intersection Number of Curves. Vincent Despré and Francis Lazarus. Journal of the ACM 66(6), Article 45, Nov. 2019.). The implementation will strongly rely on the current package functionality for the homotopy test.\nAnother interesting possibility could be to add a new functionality to this package in order to repair mesh surfaces that contain undesired non-trivial topology (small handles or tunnels). A first step is to compute a shortest cycle that is essential on a given surface, i.e. that is neither deformable to a point nor to a boundary cycle of the surface.

The package volesti is a C++ software with an R interface in CRAN which provides 4 geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex polytopes among other algorithms in the field of geometric statistics. A classical and difficult problem is to know when the Markov chain converges to the target distribution in order to stop sampling. Diagnostics are tools that can be used to check whether the quality of a sample generated with an MCMC algorithm is sufficient to provide an accurate approximation of the target distribution. The goals of this project are to provide: i) three diagnostic tools for a random walk to check convergence to the target distribution, ii) efficient implementations of all the known geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex bodies, that are not implemented in volesti and iii) an improved implementation for Billiard walk which is already implemented in volesti. The diagnostic tools would allow us to compare the mixing time of various random walks, which is a classical and hard problem in high dimensional statistics.</p>\n",

The new website would be a highly refined version of the current site in terms of the look and feel and the maintainability.</p>\n",

However, none, to our knowledge, have addressed the issue of robustness toward additive outliers, rather than innovations outliers. Muler and Yohai (2008) proposed two approaches to robust GARCH(p,q) model fitting to avoid bias in the parameter estimates and the preceding kind of over-estimation of volatility following isolated large outlier returns. In the first approach, parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood function using a modified likelihood function based on a bounded loss function. The second approach improves on the first by using a filter that limits the effect of an additive outlier on subsequent predictors of conditional variance. Our proposal is to implement the two approaches by exposing interfaces to a C++ library that can be called from any higher level language for estimating the likelihood functon. We will first develop an R implementation of the robust GARCH(p, q) fitting method, with application examples, and evaluate the performance of the code using as bench- marks selected simulation results from Muler and Yohai.</p>\n",

This project will decouple the low-level data manipulation procedures from the algebraic manipulations performed within the rest of QuTiP, encapsulating the low-level data manipulation into a higher-level interface, which will allow multiple storage formats to be used at the appropriate situations transparently.  Overall, QuTiP will be able to spread its impressive performance to all problem-size domains without compromising on future maintainability or extensibility as demands for numerical quantum simulations increase.</p>\n",

Since Cloudflare is holding such a massive portion of internet traffic, the practices Cloudflare is utilizing affects millions of people's access to the internet and their privacy on the internet. Internet users have widely demonstrated Cloudflare's discriminatory practices against anonymous Tor users and web browsers on online forums and research papers. These practices limit or completely block webpages' functionality for \"certain\" users by implementing endless CAPTCHA loops. Therefore, the \"Cloudflare CAPTCHA Monitoring\" project aims to track how often Cloudflare fronted webpages return CAPTCHAs to Tor clients. The project achieves this by fetching webpages via both Tor and other mainstream web browsers and comparing the results. The tests are repeated periodically to find the patterns over time. Collected metadata, metrics, and results are analyzed and displayed on a public dashboard to understand how Cloudflare manipulates internet traffic and affects people's access to the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/woswos/CAPTCHA-Monitor/-/wikis/home\" target=\"_blank\">Project page and documentation</a></p>\n",

At CVPR 2019, three dif- ferent solutions using this 3D representation were proposed (Occupancy Networks, DeepSDF, and IM-NET), and they show that this representation is better in some as- pects(e.g., accuracy, memory efficiency) than voxel grids or meshes, which are usually used in previous studies.\nNowadays, there are two major deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and Py- Torch. Each of them has some libraries such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which help users to use 3D models in neural networks easily. Unfortunately, none of the three works mentioned above are implemented in TensorFlow Graphics, whereas Kaolin provides their code. This is not a good situation for TensorFlow users who want to try using \"implicit 3D representations\" in their experiments or projects.\nIn this proposal, I propose a project to implement these three works in Tensorflow Graphics. I will also work on equipping some 3D geometry utilities to support users to handle the three baselines on the same interface.</p>\n",

On the other hand,  these frameworks did not support inorganic crystal and the model support was biased towards Graph Convolutional Networks.JAX Chem is a JAX-based deep learning library for complex and diverse chemical modeling. JAX Chem’s motivation is to support not only models of Graph Convolutional Networks, but also Attention-based models like Transformer,  and  even models for wave functions involving complex physical equations like SchNetOrb or FermiNet. JAX is suitable  for  such  complex  modeling  because  JAX’s  API allows you to write models declaratively.  In the period of GSoC, I will implement the  standard  GNN  model,  the  dataset  utilities  and  the  GCN  model  for  MaterialInformatics, and the Attention-based model, as the beginning of JAX Chem.</p>\n",

These days, since most of the analysis work is done in Jupyter Notebooks, thus TARDIS GUI can also be brought to the notebooks by using Jupyter widgets and interactive plotting libraries.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the existing GUI is limited in its functionality, providing only shell &amp; line information. There is lot of other information that can be analyzed from a simulation model which will be made accessible under this project, by means of new widgets.  Besides, this project also aims to make it easier for users to try out these widgets themselves.

I would propose to use model parameter optimization based on bifurcation analysis. This would use computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to generate maps of parameter space that indicate the location of bifurcations at which one type of model behavior transitions into another type. These models may use many unknown parameters and specific weights. We can construct a network by fixing the known parameters and train it on input and output to determine the unknown parameters. I believe a bifurcation analysis of this model would provide solutions for sets of states for a given set of parameters. The way we adjust parameters and weights we may analyze the computations of a neural system in how it generates ideas from the organization of a network. I hope creating an algorithm of bifurcation analysis would provide insight into features of neuronal dynamics like multistability, oscillations, and symmetry.</p>\n",

To test the implementations, I will deploy cBioPortal to Heroku so that I can test the code and ensure that it works in a remote server. \nPathwayMapper is used to construct pathways however pathways can become very complex and hard to understand as the data mounts. Some features are expected to be implemented in PathwayMapper to decrease the complexity of pathways and make it easy for users to draw conclusions.  Features expected to be implemented are \nExpand-collapse operations, Hide-show operations, Filtering, Highlighting.\nFor PathwayMapper editor features I will use functionalities that are already implemented in the Cytoscape.js.

One of the main problems that needs to be solved is the long time (latency) that it takes to move data from the computer’s main memory to the device’s memory. Therefore, using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, the proposed solution consists of adding a new functionality to the current OpenMP interprocedural optimization pass, OpenMPOpt, such that the OpenMP runtime calls that involve host to device memory transfers are split into “issue” and “wait” functions. The “issue” function will contain the code necessary to transfer the data from the host to the device in an asynchronous manner, returning a handle in which the “wait” function will wait for completion. The “issue” and “wait” functions will be moved upwards and downwards respectively, until it is illegal to do so. Doing this, the instructions between the “issue” and the “wait” can be executed, while separately doing the data transfer to the device, hence, reducing the time the process is blocked waiting for the transfer to finish.</p>\n",

The dialogue manager will be a RoboComp agent, which reads information from the robot’s world representation (a graph) and adapts the conversation to the current situation (e.g, according to the age of people, genre, etc).</p>\n",

It is used in communication with kernel i.a. to update routing tables. There areseveral different methods for reading kernel routing table information, updating kernel routingtables, and for looking up interfaces. One of them is Linux Netlink - asynchronouscommunication between kernel and user. FRRouting with its dataplane abstraction, uses aqueue of dataplane context objects for messages waiting to be sent. A separate thread loopsover this queue and sends the context objects to the appropriate dataplane. Every singlemessage is handled and sent separately, but there’s room for improvement. Certaindataplanes allow for sending multiple messages to them at once, so we could benefit from it.This would improve overall processing time. My proposal will involve implementing one ofthe proposed ideas, namely “Dataplane Batching”.</p>\n",

WebSocket provides an alternative to the limitation of inefficient communication between the server and the client by providing bi-directional, full-duplex, real-time client/server communications.

Older SVG views have been converted to HTML5 Canvas to make a responsive user interface with enhanced interactivity. A new chart containing a histogram of primitive duration has been created to filter out intervals of a specific duration. This supplements the user experience in discovery of intervals having too long or too short duration. Interpretability of the Gantt chart has been augmented by the addition of traceback lines (from a child interval to its parent) and color highlighting which eventually helps to track down dependent and relevant intervals. The hardware performance counter values have been made more explicit by representing aggregated (minimum, maximum, average) values. The Traveler interface is now equipped with more options for explorative performance analysis, better feature detection, easier artifact isolation, and faster debugging.</p>\n",

AR Simulation module provides users capability to visualize 3D objects simulation in real world scenes. AR Area module allows users to export measured \"AR measurements\" into text format and which can be used for further analysis.

To move their large data around, CERN uses a service known as Rucio. In order for scientists to be able to perform analyses on Rucio-managed data using SWAN, it must be made accessible from within the notebook. This could be done in several ways, one of which is telling Rucio to replicate the requested data to a specific storage location. To do this, scientists must use Rucio CLI or web-based UI, which could be somewhat overwhelming for some. In addition to that, they must know which storage location the data must be replicated to, and the file path to access the data once replicated. Also, the path can change after sometime, forcing them to go through the process again.</p>\n<p>To address the issue, this project aims to develop a JupyterLab extension that integrates with Rucio. It takes care of creating a replication rule and providing an easy way of getting the file path. If the data becomes unavailable, the extension can make it available again automatically.</p>\n",

QQC2 have a very broad scope, in that they provide a styling system flexible enough to allow the development of applications that have either a platform-dependent or platform-independent style. That is the reason that C++ is responsible for handling events and logic, and thus the performance is increased, allowing the visual QML layer to be a simple, declarative layer on top. This is of course reflected in the structure of the controls project: all visual implementations sit in the imports folder, so that developers who want to create their own complete style can do it easily. Because of the above, updating the Calendar widget to Qt Quick Controls 2 standards is something essential and will have a significant impact for the Qt users.</p>\n",

There have been many sophisticated GPU backends including Cuda,OpenCL,Vulkan and Halide, these GPU backends can provide reference for porting some kernels' shader code of OpenCV GPU backend to WebGPU. \n    The concepts of pipeline and buffer of OpenCV Vulkan backend have many functions that are similar to WebGPU API, so I will try to write a library to enable emscripten to convert the used Vulkan API to WebGPU API. \n    Specifically, the mapping from OpenCV Vulkan backend to OpenCV.js using WebGPU can be roughly divided into three parts. First of all, mapping Vulkan buffer to WebGPU buffer to access the storage of WebGPU.Secondly, mapping Vulkan API calls for pipeline and command buffer to WebGPU API. Thirdly I’ll reuse Vulkan's shaders. It’s feasible to reuse Vulkan’s shader directly in Chrome. Another possible approach is using SPIRV-Cross to convert SPIR-V in Vulkan shader to readable, usable and efficient GLSL/HLSL.</p>\n",

To enable greater utility of the SynBioHub platform, it is necessary to extend its capability in a manner that will enhance its usability to genetic wet-lab workers, creating a better synergy between the digital and physical workflows. When creating or using genetic designs in the laboratory, experimentalists frequently want to interrogate the information for specific DNA ‘parts’ prior to using them. The annotation of a DNA sequence will define which strings of the DNA nucleotide sequence encode specific function. Being able to visualize the correlation of sequence to function is critical for experimentalists. Currently SynBioHub lacks a visualization tool that would enable this visualization. Addressing this will greatly enhance the usability of the platform by experimentalists and this will facilitate the integration of digital and physical workflows.</p>\n",

Non-visual users find it challenging to navigate and use these websites for their intended purpose. The information in images, whether on the internet or stored locally, is also inaccessible to non-visual users.\nNVDA or NonVisual Desktop Access is a free, open-source, portable screen reader for Microsoft Windows. It already includes an OCR that can recognize text within images, however, it lacks any functionality to describe image content and allow users to interact with the various objects within images. This project aims to overcome these issues through two modules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A machine learning module to generate descriptive captions for images on the user’s screen or those manually inputted by the user.</li>\n<li>An object detection model that draws bounding boxes around recognized objects and outputs the object label when the user’s pointer enters a bounding box.\nThe outputs of both these modules could be presented to the user using NVDA’s existing mechanisms such as voice or braille.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Besides not being elegant it brings many problems with it, like not being able to save the visualizations inside the notebook for sharing or bringing visual complexity of the entire GUI into the view instead of just displaying the 3D model. It is therefore important to find a way to visualize FreeCAD's 3D scene in the IPython display system as supported by Jupyter Notebook.</p>\n<p>Tackling the open issue “IPython / Jupyter support” I aim to implement a IPython compatible visualization of FreeCAD’s 3D Open Inventor scene graph. To achieve this I intend to choose a suitable JavaScript library able to render a 3D scene graph and to implement a mapping between it and the Open Inventor scene graph. After this as a byproduct I want to implement a better WebGL export based on the scene graph instead of document objects as currently found in FreeCAD. For this I can reuse and integrate the scene graph mapping component. Lastly I want to document the results in the Wiki and create an example Jupyter notebook.</p>\n",

This enables LibRoadrunner to simulate models on par with compiled C/C++ code. By combining Libroadrunner with standard optimization algorithms it is possible to use Libroadrunner to fit models to data. At present this is done by writing code to link the standard Python optimizers available via scipy with libroadrunner. Although this works it is inefficient and for large models, it is not practical. In this project, we would like to continue the work to develop a C/C++ based optimization plugins that can be used directly by LibRoadrunner with the help of RRPlugins. RRPlugins is a software that uses Libroadrunner as a dependency to load plugins and perform optimization tasks. Now if we build roadrunner we need to build plugins again since plugins are designed in such a way that they use LibRoadRunner and RRPlugins both as a dependency. To overcome this we decided to integrate both LibRoadRunner and RRPlugins and this would enable us to provide high-performance optimization capabilities.</p>\n",

But when it comes to rapidly prototyping of applications and ease of use of APIs, it lags behind other languages like python which is one of the most widely used languages just because of this reason and also due to the plethora of libraries that it provides. So, binding the C++ APIs and exposing them to the python interface can be helpful in extending the use of innermodel lib to beginner developers with minimal knowledge of programming. By exposing C++ APIs to python we are achieving two things at the same time: getting the performance from C++ and ease of use through python, which can also increase contributions from the dev community and later help in the development of innermodel lib or robocomp in general.</p>\n",

To do so, it should invite and fulfill the needs of bioinformaticians and mathematicians while at the same time bridging the gap to wet lab experimentalists. One of these differences is the common preference of wet lab biologists to use spreadsheets, which as of now cannot be used as input for SynBioHub. This can be changed by creating a plugin, which accepts a spreadsheet as input and converts it into SBOL which can be processed by SynBioHub. This could simplify the process of data curation for publication by bridging the gap between those that perform the experiments and those that write about them from the very beginning.</p>\n",

Most of the time a sample from only one organism, of which the genome (and therefore the proteasome) is known, is analyzed. In this case choosing a suitable database does not pose a problem.<br>\nHowever if the sample contains one or multiple unknown organisms, it can be difficult to choose an adequate database.

It is a follow-up of a GSoC 2019 project in which we examined 49 packages::algorithms but we were short of time to publish the results in a clean format. \nWe intend to correct some glitches in the 2019 code and use a more recent code prepared by one mentor during winter 2020 that is more flexible and permits an evaluation of all packages::algorithms in one run.  Our NNbenchmark package, published on CRAN and regularly updated, will give the opportunity to package authors to eventually modify their code and benchmark it with the provided datasets against other packages.\nFinally, we will publish the results on a website and in an article to be published in the R-Journal.</p>\n",
