        "description_html": "<p><a href=\"http://52north.org\" target=\"_blank\">52°North</a> is an international research and development partner network with partners from academia, the public sector and industry. Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.\nSome of our software projects are enviroCar, 52°North SOS, 52°North JavaScript Sensor Web Client, ILWIS, and 52°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Ohloh page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, WaterInnEU, ODIP II).\nAll of the 52°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.\n52°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.</p>\n",

The aim here is to avoid the situation today where game developers tolerate and work around driver bugs, due to the difficulty of identifying the root cause of a problem and isolating a stand-alone repro test.</p>\n",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a> (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Blender, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>appleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&amp;D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).</p>\n<p>In October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.</p>\n",

Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on C++), and the Arduino Software (IDE or CLI tool).</p>\n<p>Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.</p>\n<p>Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.</p>\n",

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.</p>\n<p>Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (<a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider</a>) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting\nChapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the\ncloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed.\nChapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration\nwith academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique\nexperience for students to work on projects involving high-performance\ncomputing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel\nprovides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a\nseparate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism\nfeatures make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and\nprogram.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task\nwhich uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in\nperformance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that\nplacement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to\ninitially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until\nthey are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,\ntype inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or\nvice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Checker Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.</p>\n<p>Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count = \"hello\";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>We are building a platform called <strong>EvalAI</strong> as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need for evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.</p>\n<p>The platform is used by more than 20 organizations from industry and academia such as Facebook, eBay, IBM, Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech, etc. It has hosted 50+ AI challenges with 5500+ users who have created 51000+ submissions. It has more than 90+ open-source contributors and 1.3M+ page views since its launch in 2017. Several research organizations like Mapiallary research, IBM research, etc. are using its forked version for hosting their internal challenges instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>\n",

Using this tool, you can freeze a running container or individual application and checkpoint it as a collection of files on disk. You can then use the files to restore the application and run it exactly as it was during the time of the freeze. With this feature, application live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are possible.</p>\n<p>CRIU started as a sub-project of OpenVZ and grew with tremendous help from the community. It is currently packaged for many Linux distributions and is integrated into such projects as OpenVZ, Virtuozzo, LXC/LXD, Docker runc, Podman, and other software. It's a part of a container live migration tool called p.haul that automates all the steps needed to live migrate a container with the smallest \"freeze time\" possible. For that it orchestrates the work of three core CRIU functionalities -- memory pre- and lazy- c/r, general save-restore and disk-less images transfer.</p>\n<p>An essential part of the CRIU tool is the library called \"Compel\" which lets you inject so called parasite code into a running process. This library is the base of CRIU, but is independent from it and allows doing some marvellous tricks like re-directinng IO streams for processes, doing apps live-updates, manipulating the internal state of a running application in a way more powerful manner than gdb allows, etc.</p>\n",

As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million \"things\" of 685 different \"types\" in 125 languages, with over 3 billion \"facts\". It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications. For example, BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That is the kind of query we are talking about.\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</p>\n",

This operating system that we have created is called Debian.</p>\n<p>An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.</p>\n<p>Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.</p>\n<p>However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.</p>\n<p>A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.</p>\n<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.</p>\n<p>It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.</p>\n",

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://globalframenet.org\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet</a> initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h3>The Database</h3>\n<p>FN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h3>The Applications</h3>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal <a href=\"https://github.com/FrameNetBrasil/webtool\" target=\"_blank\">web annotation tool</a>, a domain-specific dictionary - the <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/world-cup-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary</a>; a system for recommending tourist attractions - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/m-knob/\" target=\"_blank\">m.knob</a>; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.</p>\n",

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD Project began 26 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

The game engine is general purpose and powerful enough for any 2D game. \nGDevelop was used for hundreds of indie games on <strong>Android, iOS</strong>, desktop (<strong>Windows/macOS/Linux</strong>) or the <strong>web</strong> (HTML5 games).</p>\n<h3>Events: making game creation intuitive for all</h3>\n<p>What makes GDevelop unique and so easy to use are the <strong>events</strong>. Events are a powerful way to express the logic of your game, without having to learn a programming language. In an event, you specify one or more conditions that are applied on the game objects. If they are fulfilled, actions are launched.\nThese events are then translated to code when the game is exported or previewed.</p>\n<p>GDevelop takes visual programming to the next step, allowing to add <em>ready-made behaviors</em> to game objects and to <em>make new behaviors</em> using these intuitive, easy to learn events.</p>\n<h3>An extensible and robust game engine</h3>\n<p>GDevelop has out of the box support for <a href=\"https://gdevelop-app.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\">physics, shaders, particles, rich text, tweens, pathfinding, a platformer engine</a>... and is bundled with 80+ examples.</p>\n<p>Extensions can be developed to enhance the game engine - all built-in features are provided by extensions. Users and developers can make extensions using <strong>JavaScript</strong> or using the <strong>visual \nevents</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game engine and the editors are based on <strong>WebGL</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> (Pixi.js, React.js for the editor interface) and <strong>WebAssembly</strong> (some parts are implemented in C++). It's easy to <a href=\"https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">start developing on the editor or extensions</a> in a few minutes!</p>\n<h3>Documentation and wiki</h3>\n<p>GDevelop is fully documented, with <strong>help pages</strong> and <strong>tutorials</strong> on <a href=\"http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/start\" target=\"_blank\">the wiki</a> (including one written during Google Season of Docs!).</p>\n",

Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>\n<p>Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling.</p>\n<p>In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute intractable multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in computational economics as, by exploiting approximate volume computation of convex bodies, we use it to detect financial crises and evaluate portfolios performance in large stock markets with hundreds of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.</p>\n",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

The notes are searchable, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor.</p>\n<p>It is officially available for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and macOS. It can sync with OneDrive, NextCloud, Dropbox, or WebDAV. It supports standard Markdown, enhanced with optional extensions, such as to-do lists, math expressions, advanced tables, etc. You can also add tags to be able to sort your notes easily and search for them when needed.</p>\n<p>Similar to Evernote, it offers a web clipper browser extension to directly take a screenshot or save webpages directly to a notebook. Both Firefox and Chrome are supported.</p>\n<p>Joplin has gained a lot of attention over the course of the last few years. Among others, <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/5-evernote-alternatives-linux/\" target=\"_blank\">It’s FOSS</a> ranked it as the #1 note-taking app. The app, with its focus on user privacy, is also <a href=\"https://www.privacytools.io/software/notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">the first recommendation on PrivacyTools</a> for Digital Notebooks.</p>\n<p>Joplin successful participated in the Hacktoberfest. The short but solid history of <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/hacktoberfest-22447274\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a> and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/31221846\" target=\"_blank\">2019</a> is showing that Joplin is strongly raising attention in the open-source community, what in turn pushed Joplin several steps ahead.</p>\n<p>The user range is increasing steadily and is expected to increase further as new desktop and mobile features are being added, and new collaboration features are being developed, in particular via Nextcloud.</p>\n<p>This application shall give it another push to satisfy some of the most desired wishes of the community and win more long-time code contributors. As it spans across diverse modern but well-established technologies, students will encounter a diverse range of programming languages, paradigms and use cases. Moreover, they will get in touch with characters all over the globe, with different demands and priorities, as in their future professional careers. There are interesting challenges to offer for any developer.</p>\n",

It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.</p>\n<p>LabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.</p>\n<h3>What is Lua?</h3>\n<p>Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.</p>\n<p>Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.</p>\n<h3>What is Céu?</h3>\n<p>Céu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.</p>\n",

An open-source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station accessible on the web for all of the network users. A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 210+ stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and 100+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Libre Space, together with the University of Patras, are the makers of UPSat, the 1st free software, open-hardware cubesat. Currently, we are developing an open-hardware satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network. In parallel, we are exploring the smaller PocketQube form factor in our Qubik mission of two PocketQube satellites and a PockeQube deployer system PicoBus.</p>\n<p>Libre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities. SDR Maker Space working on several open-source Software Defined Radio sub-activities to facilitate satellite communications and OpenSatCOM working on sustainable development practices for satellite communications projects.</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

It is widely used in the scientific community and is written by scientists for scientists.</p>\n<p>The goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics\" target=\"_blank\">molecular dynamics</a> (MD) simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/\" target=\"_blank\">new computational tools</a>.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by  MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protein databank</a> (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis is a project written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, softmatter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited almost a thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.</p>\n",

Mypy can scale to multi-million line codebases, while providing quick incremental checking through the mypy daemon.</p>\n<p>Mypy lets you freely mix type checked and unannotated code, making it possible to gradually migrate existing codebases to static type checking.</p>\n<h4>What is mypyc?</h4>\n<p>Mypyc is a compiler from a type annotated Python dialect to CPython C extension modules that uses mypy as the front end. It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient.</p>\n<p>It's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs. Modules compiled with mypyc can freely interact with interpreted modules. Mypyc lets you compile a few performance-sensitive modules and keep the rest of your program interpreted.</p>\n",

However, the data coming from mass spectrometry instruments is complex and multi-dimensional. <strong><a href=\"https://mzmine.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">MZmine</a></strong> is a very successful open-source graphical software for mass-spectrometry data processing implemented in Java. It contains a library of algorithms and powerful visualization modules. The publication about MZmine 2 (<a href=\"https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-395\" target=\"_blank\">Pluskal et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2010</a>) has been cited over 1400 times. A new version, MZmine 3, which is currently under development, is based on JavaFX for its user interface. Our main goal is to provide a user-friendly, flexible and easily extendable software with a complete set of modules covering the entire mass-spectrometry data analysis workflow. MZmine participated in GSoC in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as part of the OpenChemistry umbrella organization. Due to great interest from both students and mentors, we decided to participate as an independent organization in 2020!</p>\n",

This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader. NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards. NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.</p>\n<p>Major highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel </li>\n<li>A built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices </li>\n<li>Reporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors </li>\n<li>Support for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard </li>\n<li>Ability to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation </li>\n<li>Easy to use talking installer </li>\n<li>Support for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants </li>\n<li>Ability to run at Windows logon and other secure screens</li>\n</ul>\n",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lab</strong></p>\n<p>The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://lab.open-roberta.org/</a> is online and has had more than 500 000 visits in 2019 across more than 120 countries.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 12 different robot plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EV3 LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>NXT LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>BBC micro:bit</li>\n<li>Calliope mini</li>\n<li>Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based</li>\n<li>NAO, a humanoid robot</li>\n<li>BOB3</li>\n<li>Nepo4Arduino</li>\n<li>mBot</li>\n<li>SenseBox</li>\n<li>WeDo LEGO</li>\n<li>Edison</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>\n<p>While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide that raises all ships.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The focus is on usability through a web UI, reducing the need to learn a programming or query language.</p>\n<h4> Stack</h4>\n<p>OpenRefine is built in Java (server-side) and uses a web UI (jQuery).

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/homepage/elenco-siti-tematici/wifimetropolitano/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.</p>\n<p>From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/it/progetti/openwisp\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org\" target=\"_blank\">network management system</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.</p>\n",

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.</p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven lesson creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.</p>\n<p>Since a Kickstarter in mid-2017, <a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\">key members of our community</a> have built a <a href=\"http://live.orcasound.net\" target=\"_blank\">web app</a> that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, now in beta-testing, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite\" target=\"_blank\">web-app repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool.

Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.</p>\n",

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.</p>\n<p>We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes <a href=\"http://processing.org\" target=\"_blank\">Processing (Java)</a>, <a href=\"http://p5js.org\" target=\"_blank\">p5.js (JavaScript)</a>, and <a href=\"http://py.processing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Processing.py (Python)</a>, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.</p>\n<p>The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.</p>\n<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>\n",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2020, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 35 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX.</p>\n<p>HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.<br>\nThis library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the \nBoost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and \nvery portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including \nLinux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as \naccelerators such as the Xeon Phi.</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications \nwhich makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and \ndistributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently \nHPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the \nfuture we hope to expand its influence to include common applications \nthat touch our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC \nresearch, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check \nout our <a href=\"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-%28GSoC%29-2020\" target=\"_blank\">ideas page</a> \nand contact us either through the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) \nor via an email at \n</p>\n",

But a lot of work is still needed before it becomes a standard like GCC in the software world.</p>\n<p>To achieve SymbiFlow's goal of a complete end-to-end FOSS FPGA toolchain, a number of tools and projects are necessary. Thus, SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which deals with creating so-called <a href=\"https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs\" target=\"_blank\">FPGA \"architecture definitions\"</a>, i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.</p>\n<p>Those definitions serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys.

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We accomplish this via:</p>\n<p>Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals &amp; organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.</p>\n<p>Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2020 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Humboldt University - Germany, and Charles University - Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.30 in September 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 9000 members as of January 2020, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 250 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

We've been working for years on educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more</p>\n<p>Our contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers</p>\n<h4>Our Games</h4>\n<p><em>Terasology</em> is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p><em>Destination Sol</em> is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h4>Architecture</h4>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n<h4>Codeuino</h4>\n<p>For GSOC 2020 we're supporting <a href=\"http://codeuino.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://codeuino.org</a> to let them offer project ideas through us.</p>\n",

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Focused</strong> around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.</p>\n<p><strong>Built in JavaScript</strong> webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Used at Scale</strong> webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Owned</strong> webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling</p>\n",

        "description_html": "<p>Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other team chat tools designed to help teams (whether <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/\" target=\"_blank\">open source projects</a> or companies) collaborate effectively via its unique <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/why-zulip/\" target=\"_blank\">threading model</a>. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">much more</a> -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its <a href=\"http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html\" target=\"_blank\">extensive developer documentation</a> (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",
