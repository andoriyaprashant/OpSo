This project's primary focus is to provide a platform to facilitate automized inter-hospital kidney transplants.\n\nThis platform allows interested hospitals to register their information. Then, the doctors from the registered hospitals can create their accounts and add their patients' (having kidney problems) medical details to this platform.\n\nAfter a doctor completes this process, this platform provides two main features. The first feature is to view only the essential details required for a kidney transplant. These details are stored in a MySQL database using PHP. Second, all suitable matches from this and other registered hospitals are displayed for a given patient. These suitable matches are ranked from best match to bad match.",

Some devices detect breast cancer but many times they lead to false positives, which results in patients undergoing painful, expensive surgeries that were not even necessary. These type of cancers are called benign which do not require surgeries and we can reduce these unnecessary surgeries by using Machine Learning. I have taken the dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for women.",

MrktDB aggregates all of 13F data each quarter and bring out exclusive insights that can help users make informed decisions about their investments. \n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. It discloses their equity holdings and can provide some insights into what the smart money is doing in the market.\nSmall investors frequently use these filings to determine what the “smart money” is doing in the market, but there are serious problems with the reliability and timeliness of the data.\nThis is where MrktDB comes into picture.\n\nHere users find metrics like:\n1. Most popular stocks across all 13F filers and hedge funds\n2. Emerging favourite stocks across all filers \n3. Stocks falling out of favour among filers\n4. Best performing filers… and much more!",

We search a lot for good resources and usually end up wasting hours just searching. \n\nKeeping all the above points in mind, I started CSwaala.\nIt is a platform containing all the resources that are required to learn something that's already on the Internet. The benefit is that all these resources are curated by individuals who have already learned the skill, so they know the in and outs and are adding only those resources which really helped them.",
