While we’ve built this website to be aesthetically pleasing and interactive and easy to use for our clients, we’ve also kept in mind to encourage both the parties participating in each and every transaction to have utmost satisfaction with our platform. Our website will make the farmers aware of various government policies meant to help and further agro-technology in the country as well as find useful tips to practice sustainable methods of farming. Alongside this, there's also the option of getting services like soil-testing, water-testing , etc to help our farmer friends prosper and see an increase in production. By removing middlemen, KrishiConnect will ensure that the farmers get the pay they deserve. KrishiConnect is a website that aims at being a one-stop solution for local farmers as well as the buyers. Organic products have seen a recent growth in the market and our platform provides bifurcated interface for both the parties. Local farmers are encouraged to grow organic produce which they can sell by registering as a seller on KrishiConnect. Meanwhile, all the consumers can shop for these 100% organic, chemical free products on the retail interface of KrishiConnect. Just like any other online shopping platform, they can select the products they want to buy, add and remove them from their carts and pay using multiple payment options available. As for the farmer-side interface, an organic farmer cab register as a seller by creating a profile. They can fill in personal details like the product they wish to sell, find valuable information regarding organic cultivation and also request for on-site assistance from our team. With retail categories like organic fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, herbs and many more, farmers as well as customers have an array of choices to choose from. Technology Involved: We’ve built our website using technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript in frontend spheres like aesthetics and design. For the database management, Firebase has been used which is provided by Google for maintaining signup, login, and user database.","project_id":"100","mentors_id":"51"},{"Timestamp":"4/24/2024 12:17:42","Email address":"opensourcechandigarh@chitkara.edu.in","owner_name":"Aryan Inguz","email":"aryan1372.be22@chitkara.edu.in","GitHub Profile URL":"https://github.com/Aryainguz","LinkedIn Profile URL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-inguz-b73150254/","Name of the Organization (if any)":"Open Source Chandigarh","project_name":"Euphoria Check","project_link":"https://github.com/Open-Source-Chandigarh/Euphoria-Check","Deployment Link (if any)":"https://euphoria-check-perma-meter-express.vercel.app/","technology_used":"HTML,CSS,JavaScript,ExpressJS,NodeJS,EJS","project_video_link":"https://youtu.be/qVowNSPaa6A?si=GkvQeNOpBZVVrxEx","Tentative no. of mentors required to maintain repository/reviewers":"3","project_description":"Euphoria-Check is an open-source web application that helps you assess your well-being and happiness based on the PERMA model developed by psychologist Martin Seligman.

This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy.\n\n\nTo explain what our strategy exactly does and how is it working, we have taken the example of the Indian Market, we have taken a few securities over a specified time interval. Then we have found all the cointegrated pairs of stocks from all the possible pairs of securities by considering all the stocks having p-value less than a certain cut-off. For further analysis, we have identified the security pair with minimum p-value.\nNext we have calculated the spread of the two series. In order to actually calculate the spread, we use a linear regression to get the coefficient for the linear combination to construct between our two securities. Since, the absolute spread isn't very useful in statistical terms. It is more helpful to normalize our signal by treating it as a z-score. A Z-score is nothing but a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean.\nNext we define our strategy and generate the trading signals during backtesting on another time period which we have defined-\nGo \"Long\" the spread whenever the z-score is below -1.0\nGo \"Short\" the spread when the z-score is above 1.0\nExit positions when the z-score approaches zero\nNext we have created calculated the returns of our portfolio on the basis of strategy.","project_id":"23","mentors_id":"111"},{"Timestamp":"4/24/2024 13:27:33","Email address":"himanshunarware77@gmail.com","owner_name":"Himanshu Narware","email":"himanshunarware77@gmail.com","GitHub Profile URL":"https://github.com/HimanshuNarware","LinkedIn Profile URL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshunarware","Name of the Organization (if any)":"Devlabs","project_name":"Devlabs","project_link":"https://github.com/HimanshuNarware/Devlabs","Deployment Link (if any)":"www.devlabsstore.tech/","technology_used":"Javascript,React.js,Css,","project_video_link":"https://youtu.be/Zi-SNAUfUW8","Tentative no. of mentors required to maintain repository/reviewers":"2","project_description":"DevLabs is a website where you can search for free tools that are useful for your daily needs.
