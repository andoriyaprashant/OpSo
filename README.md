### Known Limitations

- *Limited Program Listings*: The app currently does not cover all available open-source programs. If you are looking for a specific program, check the official websites.
- *Network Dependency*: The app relies on a stable internet connection for fetching program details and updates. Offline functionality is limited.

If you encounter any issues not listed above, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/OpSo/issues) on GitHub for further assistance.

### Adding New Open Source Programs

If you would like to add information about a new open-source program to OpSo, you can contribute by:

1. Gathering comprehensive information about the program, including its objectives, eligibility criteria, application process, and important dates.
2. Creating a new screen in the app to display information about the program.
3. Adding the program to the list of options in the home screen with relevant details.
4. Testing the new feature to ensure it works correctly.

### Improving Documentation
