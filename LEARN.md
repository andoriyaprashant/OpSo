# Building OpSo: Learn Guide

Welcome to the Learn guide for building OpSo (Open Source Programs App), a Flutter app aimed at providing comprehensive information about various open-source programs. In this guide, we will walk you through the process step by step, ensuring that you understand each concept along the way. Whether you're new to Flutter or a seasoned developer looking to contribute, this guide is designed to help you get started and make meaningful contributions to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into building OpSo, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Flutter SDK: Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter on your machine.
- Git: You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the OpSo repository and manage version control.
- Code Editor: Choose a code editor of your preference. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the OpSo Repository**: Start by cloning the OpSo repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/OpSo.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the OpSo project directory using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd OpSo
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Understanding the Project Structure

Before we start making changes, let's take a moment to understand the structure of the OpSo project:

- **lib/**: This directory contains all the Dart code for the OpSo app.
- **assets/**: This directory stores static assets such as images and fonts.
- **test/**: Unit tests for the project.
- **android/** & **ios/**: These directories contain platform-specific configuration files for Android and iOS.

## Making Changes

Now that we're familiar with the project structure, let's make some changes to the app:

1. **Explore the Code**: Open the project in your chosen code editor and explore the `lib/` directory. Take a look at the existing screens, widgets, and services to understand how the app works.
   
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch depending uon the type of issue we are implementing such as a Bugfix, Implementing a new feature, Hotfix,etc.
   ```
   create branch -b Type/branchName-YourName-newBranchName
   ```
  
3. **Add a New Feature**: Choose a feature you'd like to work on or improve. It could be adding support for a new open-source program, improving the user interface, or fixing a bug.

4. **Implement the Feature**: Write the necessary Dart code to implement your chosen feature. Make sure to follow best practices and adhere to the existing code style.

5. **Test Your Changes**: Once you've implemented the feature, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Run the app on both Android and iOS devices/emulators to check for any platform-specific issues.

6. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them using Git. Include a descriptive commit message to explain the purpose of your changes.

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and create a pull request against the main OpSo repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request, including any relevant screenshots or links.

## Resources for Learning

If you encounter any difficulties while building OpSo, don't hesitate to seek help from the following resources:

- **Flutter Documentation**: The official Flutter documentation provides comprehensive guides and tutorials for Flutter development.
- **Stack Overflow**: Search for existing questions or ask your own on Stack Overflow. Many experienced developers are willing to help.
